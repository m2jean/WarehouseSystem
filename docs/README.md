# Warehouse System
A course project written by Kelei Xu, Peiji Wang and me in Nanjing University in 2014.
Written in pure Java. Able to run remotely with a server with RPC. GUI is written with Swing and only in Chinese.

## Introduction
The application is designed to digitalize the warehouse management, which involves several different positions. These are the warehouse keeper, the salesman, the accountant and the manager. Before any action is taken by the employees, they fill a form and submit it to the manager for permission. The manager can either permit, reject, or modify the forms.
